== [[SparkStrategy]] SparkStrategy -- Base for Execution Planning Strategies

`SparkStrategy` is a Catalyst link:spark-sql-catalyst-GenericStrategy.adoc[GenericStrategy] that converts a link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[logical plan] into zero or more link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc[physical plans].

`SparkStrategy` marks link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[logical plans] (i.e. `LogicalPlan`) to be planned later (by some other `SparkStrategy` or after other `SparkStrategy` strategies have finished) using <<PlanLater, PlanLater>> physical operator.

----
