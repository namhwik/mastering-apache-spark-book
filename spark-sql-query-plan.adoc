== [[QueryPlan]] Query Plan

CAUTION: FIXME

`QueryPlan` abstract class has a <<output, output>> (that is a sequence of <<Attribute, Attribute>> instances). You can also ask for <<schema, schema>>.

NOTE: `QueryPlan` is a super type of link:spark-sql-spark-plan.adoc[SparkPlan] and link:spark-sql-logical-plan.adoc[LogicalPlan] abstract classes.

=== [[schema]] schema

You can find out about the schema of a `QueryPlan` using `schema` that builds link:spark-sql-dataframe-structtype.adoc[StructType] from the <<output, output attributes>>.

=== [[output]] Output Attributes

=== [[Attribute]] Attribute
