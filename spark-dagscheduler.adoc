== DAGScheduler

[NOTE]
====
The introduction that follows was highly influenced by the scaladoc of https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala[org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGScheduler]. As DAGScheduler is a private class it does not appear in the official API documentation. You are strongly encouraged to read https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala[the sources] and only then read this and the related pages afterwards.

_"Reading the sources"_, I say?! Yes, I _am_ kidding!

=== Introduction

*DAGScheduler* is the scheduling layer of Apache Spark that implements *stage-oriented scheduling*, i.e. after an RDD action has been called it becomes a job that is then transformed into a set of stages that are submitted as TaskSets for execution (see link:spark-execution-model.adoc[Execution Model]).

.Executing action leads to new ResultStage and ActiveJob in DAGScheduler
image::images/dagscheduler-rdd-partitions-job-resultstage.png[align="center"]

The fundamental concepts of `DAGScheduler` are *jobs* and *stages* (refer to link:spark-dagscheduler-jobs.adoc[Jobs] and link:spark-dagscheduler-stages.adoc[Stages] respectively) that it tracks through <<internal-registries, internal registries and counters>>.

DAGScheduler works solely on the driver and is created as part of link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#creating-instance[SparkContext's initialization] (right after link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc[TaskScheduler] and link:spark-scheduler-backends.adoc[SchedulerBackend] are ready).

.DAGScheduler as created by SparkContext with other services
image::images/dagscheduler-new-instance.png[align="center"]

DAGScheduler does three things in Spark (thorough explanations follow):

* Computes an *execution DAG*, i.e. DAG of stages, for a job.
* Determines the <<preferred-locations, preferred locations>> to run each task on.
* Handles failures due to *shuffle output files* being lost.

It computes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph[a directed acyclic graph (DAG)] of stages for each job, keeps track of which RDDs and stage outputs are materialized, and finds a minimal schedule to run jobs. It then submits stages to link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc[TaskScheduler].

In addition to coming up with the execution DAG, DAGScheduler also determines the preferred locations to run each task on, based on the current cache status, and passes the information to link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc[TaskScheduler].

Furthermore, it handles failures due to shuffle output files being lost, in which case old stages may need to be resubmitted. Failures within a stage that are not caused by shuffle file loss are handled by the TaskScheduler itself, which will retry each task a small number of times before cancelling the whole stage.

DAGScheduler uses an *event queue architecture* in which a thread can post `DAGSchedulerEvent` events, e.g. a new job or stage being submitted, that DAGScheduler reads and executes sequentially. See the section <<event-loop, Internal Event Loop - dag-scheduler-event-loop>>.

DAGScheduler runs stages in topological order.

[TIP]
====
Enable `INFO`, `DEBUG` or `TRACE` logging levels for `org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGSchedule` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGScheduler=TRACE
```

Refer to link:spark-logging.adoc[Logging].
====

DAGScheduler needs link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc[SparkContext], link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc[Task Scheduler], link:spark-LiveListenerBus.adoc[LiveListenerBus], link:spark-service-mapoutputtracker.adoc[MapOutputTracker] and link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[Block Manager] to work. However, at the very minimum, DAGScheduler needs SparkContext only (and asks SparkContext for the other services).

DAGScheduler reports metrics about its execution (refer to the section <<metrics, Metrics>>).

When DAGScheduler schedules a job as a result of link:spark-rdd.adoc#actions[executing an action on a RDD] or link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#running-jobs[calling SparkContext.runJob() method directly], it spawns parallel tasks to compute (partial) results per partition.

=== [[creating-instance]][[initialization]] Creating DAGScheduler Instance

[source, scala]
----
DAGScheduler(
  sc: SparkContext,
  taskScheduler: TaskScheduler,
  listenerBus: LiveListenerBus,
  mapOutputTracker: MapOutputTrackerMaster,
  blockManagerMaster: BlockManagerMaster,
  env: SparkEnv,
  clock: Clock = new SystemClock())
----

`DAGScheduler` requires a link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc[SparkContext], link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc[TaskScheduler], link:spark-LiveListenerBus.adoc[LiveListenerBus], link:spark-service-mapoutputtracker.adoc#MapOutputTrackerMaster[MapOutputTrackerMaster], link:spark-BlockManagerMaster.adoc[BlockManagerMaster], link:spark-sparkenv.adoc[SparkEnv], and a `Clock`.

NOTE: `DAGScheduler` can reference all the services through a single link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc[SparkContext].

When created, `DAGScheduler` does the following (in order):

1. Creates a `DAGSchedulerSource`
2. Creates <<messageScheduler, messageScheduler>>
3. Creates <<eventProcessLoop, eventProcessLoop>> and immediatelly link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc#setDAGScheduler[sets itself in the current `TaskScheduler`]
5. Initializes the <<internal-registries, internal registries and counters>>.

At the very end of the initialization, `DAGScheduler` starts <<eventProcessLoop, eventProcessLoop>>.

=== [[internal-registries]] Internal Registries and Counters

`DAGScheduler` use internal registries for housekeeping.

.`DAGScheduler` Internal Registries and Counters
[frame="topbot",cols="1,2",options="header",width="100%"]
|======================
| Name | Description
| `nextJobId` | The next job id
| `nextStageId` | The next stage id
| `jobIdToStageIds` | The lookup table of all stages per `ActiveJob` id
| `stageIdToStage` | The lookup table of stages per id
| `shuffleIdToMapStage` | The lookup table of link:spark-dagscheduler-ShuffleMapStage.adoc[ShuffleMapStage] per shuffle id
| `jobIdToActiveJob` | The lookup table of ``ActiveJob``s per job id.
| `waitingStages` | The stages with parents to be computed
| `runningStages` | The stages currently running.
| `failedStages` | The stages that failed due to fetch failures (as reported by <<handleTaskCompletion-FetchFailed, CompletionEvents for FetchFailed end reasons>>) and are going to be <<resubmitFailedStages, resubmitted>>.
| `activeJobs` | A collection of `ActiveJob` instances
| `cacheLocs` | A lookup table of cache locations per RDD id.

See <<cache-tracking, Cache Tracking>>.
| `failedEpoch` | The lookup table of failed executors per the epoch number when the failure was caught per executor.
|======================

=== [[clearCacheLocs]] Clearing Partition Cache Locations of RDDs -- `clearCacheLocs` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
clearCacheLocs(): Unit
----

`clearCacheLocs` clears partition cache locations of RDDs.

NOTE: `clearCacheLocs` is used in <<resubmitFailedStages, resubmitFailedStages>>, link:spark-dagscheduler-DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop.adoc#handleJobSubmitted[handleJobSubmitted], `handleMapStageSubmitted`, link:spark-dagscheduler-DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop.adoc#handleTaskCompletion[handleTaskCompletion], `handleExecutorLost`.

=== [[failJobAndIndependentStages]] Failing Active Job and Stages -- `failJobAndIndependentStages` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
failJobAndIndependentStages(
  job: ActiveJob,
  failureReason: String,
  exception: Option[Throwable] = None): Unit
----

The internal `failJobAndIndependentStages` method fails the input `job` and all the stages that are only used by the job.

Internally, `failJobAndIndependentStages` uses `jobIdToStageIds` to find the stages registered for the job.

If no stages could be found, you should see the following ERROR message in the logs:

```
ERROR No stages registered for job [id]
```

Otherwise, for every stage, `failJobAndIndependentStages` finds the job ids the stage belongs to.

If no stages could be found or the job is not referenced by the stages, you should see the following ERROR message in the logs:

```
ERROR Job [id] not registered for stage [id] even though that stage was registered for the job
```

Only when there is exactly one job registered for the stage and the stage is in RUNNING state (in `runningStages` internal registry), link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc#cancelTasks[`TaskScheduler` is requested to cancel the stage's tasks] and <<markStageAsFinished, marks the stage finished>>.

NOTE: `failJobAndIndependentStages` is called from link:spark-dagscheduler-DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop.adoc#handleJobCancellation[handleJobCancellation] and `abortStage`.

NOTE: `failJobAndIndependentStages` uses `jobIdToStageIds`, `stageIdToStage`, and `runningStages` <<internal-registries, internal registries>>.

=== [[submitJob]] Posting JobSubmitted Event to dag-scheduler-event-loop Event Loop -- `submitJob` method

[source, scala]
----
submitJob[T, U](
  rdd: RDD[T],
  func: (TaskContext, Iterator[T]) => U,
  partitions: Seq[Int],
  callSite: CallSite,
  resultHandler: (Int, U) => Unit,
  properties: Properties): JobWaiter[U]
----

`submitJob` creates a <<JobWaiter, JobWaiter>> and posts a link:spark-dagscheduler-DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop.adoc#JobSubmitted[`JobSubmitted` event].

.DAGScheduler.submitJob
image::images/dagscheduler-submitjob.png[align="center"]

Internally, `submitJob` does the following:

1. Checks whether `partitions` reference available partitions of the input `rdd`.
2. Increments the internal `nextJobId` job counter.
3. Returns a 0-task <<JobWaiter, JobWaiter>> when the number of `partitions` is zero.
4. Posts a `JobSubmitted` event and returns a `JobWaiter`.

You may see a `IllegalArgumentException` thrown when the input `partitions` references any partitions not in the input `rdd`:

```
Attempting to access a non-existent partition: [p]. Total number of partitions: [maxPartitions]
```

NOTE: `submitJob` is called by link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#submitJob[`SparkContext` to submit a job] and <<runJob, DAGScheduler>>.

NOTE: `submitJob` assumes that the partitions of a RDD are indexed from 0 onwards in sequential order.

=== [[messageScheduler]] `messageScheduler` Single-Thread Executor

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[resubmitFailedStages]] `resubmitFailedStages` Method

`resubmitFailedStages()` is called to go over <<internal-registries, failedStages>> collection (of failed stages) and submit them (using <<submitStage, submitStage>>).

If the failed stages collection contains any stage, the following INFO message appears in the logs:

```
INFO Resubmitting failed stages
```

`cacheLocs` and <<internal-registries, failedStages>> are cleared, and failed stages are <<submitStage, submitStage>> one by one, ordered by job ids (in an increasing order).

Ultimately, all waiting stages are submitted (using <<submitWaitingStages, submitWaitingStages>>).

=== [[runJob]] `runJob` method

When executed, `DAGScheduler.runJob` is given the following arguments:

* A *RDD* to run job on.
* A *function* to run on each partition of the RDD.
* A set of *partitions* to run on (not all partitions are always required to compute a job for actions like `first()` or `take()`).
* A callback *function* `resultHandler` to pass results of executing the function to.
* *Properties* to attach to a job.

It calls <<submitJob, submitJob>> and then waits until a result comes using a <<JobWaiter, JobWaiter>> object. A job can succeed or fail.

When a job succeeds, the following INFO shows up in the logs:

```
INFO Job [jobId] finished: [callSite], took [time] s
```

When a job fails, the following INFO shows up in the logs:

```
INFO Job [jobId] failed: [callSite], took [time] s
```

The method finishes by throwing an exception.

=== [[JobListener]] JobListener and Completion Events

You can listen for job completion or failure events after submitting a job to the DAGScheduler using `JobListener`. It is a `private[spark]` contract (a Scala trait) with the following two methods:

[source, scala]
----
private[spark] trait JobListener {
  def taskSucceeded(index: Int, result: Any)
  def jobFailed(exception: Exception)
}
----

A job listener is notified each time a task succeeds (by `def taskSucceeded(index: Int, result: Any)`), as well as if the whole job fails (by `def jobFailed(exception: Exception)`).

An instance of `JobListener` is used in the following places:

* In `ActiveJob` as a listener to notify if tasks in this job finish or the job fails.
* In `DAGScheduler.handleJobSubmitted`
* In `DAGScheduler.handleMapStageSubmitted`
* In `JobSubmitted`
* In `MapStageSubmitted`

The following are the job listeners used:

* <<JobWaiter, JobWaiter>> waits until DAGScheduler completes the job and passes the results of tasks to a `resultHandler` function.
* `ApproximateActionListener` FIXME

==== [[JobWaiter]] JobWaiter

A `JobWaiter` is an extension of <<JobListener, JobListener>>. It is used as the return value of <<submitJob, submitJob>> and `DAGScheduler.submitMapStage`. You can use a JobWaiter to block until the job finishes executing or to cancel it.

While the methods execute, link:spark-dagscheduler-DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop.adoc#JobSubmitted[`JobSubmitted`] and `MapStageSubmitted` events are posted that reference the JobWaiter.

Since a `JobWaiter` object is a `JobListener` it gets notifications about `taskSucceeded` and `jobFailed`. When the total number of tasks (that equals the number of partitions to compute) equals the number of `taskSucceeded`, the `JobWaiter` instance is marked succeeded. A `jobFailed` event marks the `JobWaiter` instance failed.

* FIXME Who's using `submitMapStage`?

=== [[executorAdded]] Announcing New Executor -- `executorAdded` Method

[source, scala]
----
executorAdded(execId: String, host: String): Unit
----

`executorAdded` simply posts a <<ExecutorAdded, ExecutorAdded>> event to the internal link:spark-dagscheduler-DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop.adoc[DAGSchedulerEvent event bus].

=== [[taskEnded]] `taskEnded` Method

[source, scala]
----
taskEnded(
  task: Task[_],
  reason: TaskEndReason,
  result: Any,
  accumUpdates: Map[Long, Any],
  taskInfo: TaskInfo,
  taskMetrics: TaskMetrics): Unit
----

`taskEnded` method simply posts a <<CompletionEvent, CompletionEvent>> event to the <<eventProcessLoop, DAGScheduler's internal event loop>>.

NOTE: `DAGScheduler.taskEnded` method is called by a link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc[TaskSetManager] to report task completions, failures including.

TIP: Read about `TaskMetrics` in link:spark-taskscheduler-taskmetrics.adoc[TaskMetrics].

=== [[markStageAsFinished]] Marking Stage Finished -- `markStageAsFinished` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
markStageAsFinished(stage: Stage, errorMessage: Option[String] = None): Unit
----

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[cancelJob]] `cancelJob` Method

[source, scala]
----
cancelJob(jobId: Int): Unit
----

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[event-loop]][[eventProcessLoop]] dag-scheduler-event-loop - Internal Event Loop

`DAGScheduler.eventProcessLoop` is the link:spark-dagscheduler-DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop.adoc[DAGScheduler event process loop] to which Spark (by <<submitJob, submitJob>>) posts jobs to schedule their execution. Later on, link:spark-tasksetmanager.adoc[TaskSetManager] talks back to DAGScheduler to inform about the status of the tasks using the same "communication channel".

It allows Spark to release the current thread when posting happens and let the event loop handle events on a separate thread - asynchronously.

...IMAGE...FIXME

[CAUTION]
====
FIXME

* What is an approximate job (as in `DAGScheduler.runApproximateJob`)?
* statistics? `MapOutputStatistics`?
====

=== [[createResultStage]] `createResultStage` method

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[submitWaitingStages]] Submit Waiting Stages -- `submitWaitingStages` Method

`DAGScheduler.submitWaitingStages` method checks for waiting or failed stages that could now be eligible for submission.

The following `TRACE` messages show in the logs when the method is called:

```
TRACE DAGScheduler: Checking for newly runnable parent stages
TRACE DAGScheduler: running: [runningStages]
TRACE DAGScheduler: waiting: [waitingStages]
TRACE DAGScheduler: failed: [failedStages]
```

The method clears the internal `waitingStages` set with stages that wait for their parent stages to finish.

It goes over the waiting stages sorted by job ids in increasing order and calls <<submitStage, submitStage>> method.

=== [[submitStage]] Submitting Stage for Execution -- `submitStage` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
submitStage(stage: Stage)
----

`submitStage` is an internal method that `DAGScheduler` uses to submit the input `stage` or its missing parents (if there any).

It recursively submits any missing parents of the stage.

Internally, `submitStage` first finds the earliest-created `ActiveJob` that needs the `stage`.

You should see the following DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG DAGScheduler: submitStage([stage])
```

Only when the `stage` is not in waiting (`waitingStages`), running (`runningStages`) or <<failedStages, failed>> states `submitStage` proceeds.

The <<getMissingParentStages, list of missing parent stages of the `stage` is calculated>> (sorted by their ids) and the following DEBUG message shows up in the logs:

```
DEBUG DAGScheduler: missing: [missing]
```

When the `stage` has no parent stages missing, you should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO DAGScheduler: Submitting [stage] ([stage.rdd]), which has no missing parents
```

The stage is <<submitMissingTasks, submitted>>. That finishes the stage submission.

If however there are missing parent stages for the `stage`, all parent stages are <<submitStage, submitted>> (by id in increasing order), and the `stage` is added to `waitingStages` stages.

In case when `submitStage` could find no active job for the `stage`, it calls <<abortStage, abortStage>> with the reason:

```
No active job for stage [id]
```

=== [[abortStage]] `abortStage` Internal Method

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[getMissingParentStages]][[calculating-missing-parent-stages]] Calculating Missing Parent Map Stages -- `getMissingParentStages` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
getMissingParentStages(stage: Stage): List[Stage]
----

`getMissingParentStages` calculates missing parent map stages for the input `stage`.

It starts with the stage's target RDD (as `stage.rdd`). If there are <<cache-tracking, uncached partitions>>, it traverses the dependencies of the RDD (as `RDD.dependencies`) that can be the instances of link:spark-rdd-dependencies.adoc#ShuffleDependency[ShuffleDependency] or link:spark-rdd-dependencies.adoc#NarrowDependency[NarrowDependency].

For each ShuffleDependency, the method searches for the corresponding link:spark-dagscheduler-ShuffleMapStage.adoc[ShuffleMapStage] (using `getShuffleMapStage`) and if unavailable, the method adds it to a set of missing (map) stages.

CAUTION: FIXME Review `getShuffleMapStage`

CAUTION: FIXME...IMAGE with ShuffleDependencies queried

It continues traversing the chain for each NarrowDependency (using `Dependency.rdd`).

=== [[stage-attempts]] Fault recovery - stage attempts

A single stage can be re-executed in multiple *attempts* due to fault recovery. The number of attempts is configured (FIXME).

If `TaskScheduler` reports that a task failed because a map output file from a previous stage was lost, the DAGScheduler resubmits that lost stage. This is detected through a `CompletionEvent` with `FetchFailed`, or an <<ExecutorLost, ExecutorLost>> event. `DAGScheduler` will wait a small amount of time to see whether other nodes or tasks fail, then resubmit `TaskSets` for any lost stage(s) that compute the missing tasks.

Please note that tasks from the old attempts of a stage could still be running.

A stage object tracks multiple `StageInfo` objects to pass to Spark listeners or the web UI.

The latest `StageInfo` for the most recent attempt for a stage is accessible through `latestInfo`.

=== [[cache-tracking]] Cache Tracking

DAGScheduler tracks which RDDs are cached to avoid recomputing them and likewise remembers which shuffle map stages have already produced output files to avoid redoing the map side of a shuffle.

DAGScheduler is only interested in cache location coordinates, i.e. host and executor id, per partition of an RDD.

CAUTION: FIXME: A diagram, please

If link:spark-rdd-caching.adoc[the storage level of an RDD is NONE], there is no caching and hence no partition cache locations are available. In such cases, whenever asked, DAGScheduler returns a collection with empty-location elements for each partition. The empty-location elements are to mark *uncached partitions*.

Otherwise, a collection of `RDDBlockId` instances for each partition is created and spark-BlockManagerMaster.adoc[BlockManagerMaster] is asked for locations (using `BlockManagerMaster.getLocations`). The result is then mapped to a collection of `TaskLocation` for host and executor id.

=== [[preferred-locations]] Preferred Locations

DAGScheduler computes where to run each task in a stage based on link:spark-rdd.adoc#preferred-locations[the preferred locations of its underlying RDDs], or <<cache-tracking, the location of cached or shuffle data>>.

=== [[adaptive-query-planning]] Adaptive Query Planning

See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-9850[SPARK-9850 Adaptive execution in Spark] for the design document. The work is currently in progress.

https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L661[DAGScheduler.submitMapStage] method is used for adaptive query planning, to run map stages and look at statistics about their outputs before submitting downstream stages.

=== ScheduledExecutorService daemon services

DAGScheduler uses the following ScheduledThreadPoolExecutors (with the policy of removing cancelled tasks from a work queue at time of cancellation):

* `dag-scheduler-message` - a daemon thread pool using `j.u.c.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` with core pool size `1`. It is used to post `ResubmitFailedStages` when `FetchFailed` is reported.

They are created using `ThreadUtils.newDaemonSingleThreadScheduledExecutor` method that uses Guava DSL to instantiate a ThreadFactory.

=== [[submitMissingTasks]] Submit Missing Tasks for Stage and Job -- `submitMissingTasks` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
submitMissingTasks(stage: Stage, jobId: Int): Unit
----

`submitMissingTasks` is a private method that...FIXME

When executed, it prints the following DEBUG message out to the logs:

```
DEBUG DAGScheduler: submitMissingTasks([stage])
```

`pendingPartitions` internal field of the stage is cleared (it is later filled out with the partitions to run tasks for).

The stage is asked for partitions to compute (see link:spark-dagscheduler-stages.adoc#findMissingPartitions[findMissingPartitions] in Stages).

The method adds the stage to `runningStages`.

The stage is told to be started to link:spark-service-outputcommitcoordinator.adoc[OutputCommitCoordinator] (using `outputCommitCoordinator.stageStart`)

CAUTION: FIXME Review `outputCommitCoordinator.stageStart`

The mapping between task ids and task preferred locations is computed (see <<computing-preferred-locations, getPreferredLocs - Computing Preferred Locations for Tasks and Partitions>>).

A new stage attempt is created (using `Stage.makeNewStageAttempt`).

link:spark-SparkListener.adoc#SparkListenerStageSubmitted[SparkListenerStageSubmitted] is posted.

The stage is serialized and broadcast to workers using link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#creating-broadcast-variables[SparkContext.broadcast] method, i.e. it is `Serializer.serialize` to calculate `taskBinaryBytes` - an array of bytes of (rdd, func) for link:spark-dagscheduler-ResultStage.adoc[ResultStage] and (rdd, shuffleDep) for link:spark-dagscheduler-ShuffleMapStage.adoc[ShuffleMapStage].

CAUTION: FIXME Review `taskBinaryBytes`.

When serializing the stage fails, the stage is removed from the internal `runningStages` set, `abortStage` is called and the method stops.

CAUTION: FIXME Review `abortStage`.

At this point in time, the stage is on workers.

For each partition to compute for the stage, a collection of <<spark-taskscheduler.adoc#shufflemaptask, ShuffleMapTask>> for link:spark-dagscheduler-ShuffleMapStage.adoc[ShuffleMapStage] or
`ResultTask` for link:spark-dagscheduler-ResultStage.adoc[ResultStage] is created.

CAUTION: FIXME Image with creating tasks for partitions in the stage.

If there are tasks to launch (there are missing partitions in the stage), the following INFO and DEBUG messages are in the logs:

```
INFO DAGScheduler: Submitting [tasks.size] missing tasks from [stage] ([stage.rdd])
DEBUG DAGScheduler: New pending partitions: [stage.pendingPartitions]
```

All tasks in the collection become a link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet] for link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc#contract[TaskScheduler.submitTasks].

In case of no tasks to be submitted for a stage, a DEBUG message shows up in the logs.

For link:spark-dagscheduler-ShuffleMapStage.adoc[ShuffleMapStage]:

```
DEBUG DAGScheduler: Stage [stage] is actually done; (available: ${stage.isAvailable},available outputs: ${stage.numAvailableOutputs},partitions: ${stage.numPartitions})
```

For link:spark-dagscheduler-ResultStage.adoc[ResultStage]:

```
DEBUG DAGScheduler: Stage [stage] is actually done; (partitions: [numPartitions])
```

NOTE: `submitMissingTasks` is called when...

=== [[computing-preferred-locations]] Computing Preferred Locations for Tasks and Partitions -- `getPreferredLocs` Method

CAUTION: FIXME Review + why does the method return a sequence of TaskLocations?

NOTE: Task ids correspond to partition ids.

=== [[stop]][[stopping]] Stopping DAGScheduler -- `stop` Method

[source, scala]
----
stop(): Unit
----

`stop` stops the internal `dag-scheduler-message` thread pool, <<event-loop, dag-scheduler-event-loop>>, and link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc[TaskScheduler].

=== [[metrics]] Metrics

Spark's DAGScheduler uses link:spark-metrics.adoc[Spark Metrics System] (via `DAGSchedulerSource`) to report metrics about internal status.

CAUTION: FIXME What is `DAGSchedulerSource`?

The name of the source is *DAGScheduler*.

It emits the following numbers:

* *stage.failedStages* - the number of failed stages
* *stage.runningStages* - the number of running stages
* *stage.waitingStages* - the number of waiting stages
* *job.allJobs* - the number of all jobs
* *job.activeJobs* - the number of active jobs

=== [[updateAccumulators]] Updating Accumulators with Partial Values from Completed Tasks -- `updateAccumulators` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
updateAccumulators(event: CompletionEvent): Unit
----

The private `updateAccumulators` method merges the partial values of accumulators from a completed task into their "source" accumulators on the driver.

NOTE: It is called by <<handleTaskCompletion, handleTaskCompletion>>.

For each link:spark-accumulators.adoc#AccumulableInfo[AccumulableInfo] in the `CompletionEvent`, a partial value from a task is obtained (from `AccumulableInfo.update`) and added to the driver's accumulator (using `Accumulable.++=` method).

For named accumulators with the update value being a non-zero value, i.e. not `Accumulable.zero`:

* `stage.latestInfo.accumulables` for the `AccumulableInfo.id` is set
* `CompletionEvent.taskInfo.accumulables` has a new link:spark-accumulators.adoc#AccumulableInfo[AccumulableInfo] added.

CAUTION: FIXME Where are `Stage.latestInfo.accumulables` and `CompletionEvent.taskInfo.accumulables` used?

=== [[settings]] Settings

* `spark.test.noStageRetry` (default: `false`) - if enabled, FetchFailed will not cause stage retries, in order to surface the problem. Used for testing.
