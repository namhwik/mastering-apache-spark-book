== [[Window]] Window Unary Logical Operator

`Window` is a link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc#UnaryNode[unary logical operator] that is created for:

* a collection of link:spark-sql-Expression.adoc#NamedExpression[named expressions] (for windows)
* a collection of link:spark-sql-Expression.adoc[expressions] (for partitions)
* a collection of `SortOrder` (for sorting) and a child link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[logical plan].

The `output` (collection of link:spark-sql-Expression-Attribute.adoc[Attributes]) is the child's attributes and the window's.

`Window` logical plan is a subject of pruning unnecessary window expressions in link:spark-sql-Optimizer-ColumnPruning.adoc[ColumnPruning] rule and pushing filter operators in link:spark-sql-Optimizer-PushDownPredicate.adoc[PushDownPredicate] rule.
