== [[AccumulatorV2]] Accumulators

*Accumulators* are variables that are "added" to through an associative and commutative "add" operation. They act as a container for accumulating partial values across multiple tasks running on executors. They are designed to be used safely and efficiently in parallel and distributed Spark computations and are meant for distributed counters and sums.

You can create built-in accumulators for link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#creating-accumulators[longs, doubles, or collections] or register custom accumulators using the link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#register[SparkContext.register] methods. You can create accumulators with or without a name, but only <<named, named accumulators>> are displayed in link:spark-webui-StagePage.adoc#accumulators[web UI] (under Stages tab for a given stage).

Accumulator are write-only variables for executors. They can be added to by executors and read by the driver only.

```
executor1: accumulator.add(incByExecutor1)
executor2: accumulator.add(incByExecutor2)

driver:  println(accumulator.value)
```

Accumulators are not thread-safe. They do not really have to since the link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#updateAccumulators[DAGScheduler.updateAccumulators] method that the driver uses to update the values of accumulators after a task completes (successfully or with a failure) is only executed on a link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#eventProcessLoop[single thread that runs scheduling loop]. Beside that, they are write-only data structures for workers that have their own local accumulator reference whereas accessing the value of an accumulator is only allowed by the driver.

Accumulators are serializable so they can safely be referenced in the code executed in executors and then safely send over the wire for execution.

[source, scala]
----
val counter = sc.longAccumulator("counter")
sc.parallelize(1 to 9).foreach(x => counter.add(x))
----

Internally, link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#longAccumulator[longAccumulator], link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#doubleAccumulator[doubleAccumulator], and link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#collectionAccumulator[collectionAccumulator] methods create the built-in typed accumulators and call link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#register[SparkContext.register].

TIP: Read the official documentation about http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#accumulators[Accumulators].

=== [[AccumulatorV2]] AccumulatorV2

[source, scala]
----
abstract class AccumulatorV2[IN, OUT]
----

`AccumulatorV2` parameterized class represents an accumulator that accumulates `IN` values to produce `OUT` result.

==== [[register]] Registering Accumulator (register method)

[source, scala]
----
register(
  sc: SparkContext,
  name: Option[String] = None,
  countFailedValues: Boolean = false): Unit
----

`register` is a `private[spark]` method of the `AccumulatorV2` abstract class.

It creates a `AccumulatorMetadata` metadata object for the accumulator (with a new unique identifier) and registers the accumulator with <<AccumulatorContext, AccumulatorContext>>. The accumulator is then link:spark-service-contextcleaner.adoc#registerAccumulatorForCleanup[registered with `ContextCleaner` for cleanup].

=== [[AccumulatorContext]] AccumulatorContext

`AccumulatorContext` is a `private[spark]` internal object used to track accumulators by Spark itself using an internal `originals` lookup table. Spark uses the `AccumulatorContext` object to register and unregister accumulators.

The `originals` lookup table maps accumulator identifier to the accumulator itself.

Every accumulator has its own unique accumulator id that is assigned using the internal `nextId` counter.

==== [[AccumulatorContext-SQL_ACCUM_IDENTIFIER]] AccumulatorContext.SQL_ACCUM_IDENTIFIER

`AccumulatorContext.SQL_ACCUM_IDENTIFIER` is an internal identifier for Spark SQL's internal accumulators. The value is `sql` and Spark uses it to distinguish link:spark-sql-catalyst-SparkPlan.adoc#SQLMetric[Spark SQL metrics] from others.

=== [[named]] Named Accumulators

An accumulator can have an optional name that you can specify when link:spark-sparkcontext.adoc#creating-accumulators[creating an accumulator].

[source, scala]
----
val counter = sc.longAccumulator("counter")
----

=== [[AccumulableInfo]] AccumulableInfo

`AccumulableInfo` contains information about a task's local updates to an <<Accumulable, Accumulable>>.

* `id` of the accumulator
* optional `name` of the accumulator
* optional partial `update` to the accumulator from a task
* `value`
* whether or not it is `internal`
* whether or not to `countFailedValues` to the final value of the accumulator for failed tasks
* optional `metadata`

`AccumulableInfo` is used to transfer accumulator updates from executors to the driver every executor heartbeat or when a task finishes.

Create an [[AccumulableInfo]] representation of this [[Accumulable]] with the provided values.

=== When are Accumulators Updated?

=== [[examples]] Examples

==== [[example-distributed-counter]] Example: Distributed Counter

Imagine you are requested to write a distributed counter. What do you think about the following solutions? What are the pros and cons of using it?

[source, scala]
----
val ints = sc.parallelize(0 to 9, 3)

var counter = 0
ints.foreach { n =>
  println(s"int: $n")
  counter = counter + 1
}
println(s"The number of elements is $counter")
----

How would you go about doing the calculation using accumulators?

==== [[example1]] Example: Using Accumulators in Transformations and Guarantee Exactly-Once Update

CAUTION: FIXME Code with failing transformations (tasks) that update accumulator (`Map`) with `TaskContext` info.

==== [[example2]] Example: Custom Accumulator

CAUTION: FIXME Improve the earlier example

==== [[example3]] Example: Distributed Stopwatch

NOTE: This is _almost_ a raw copy of org.apache.spark.ml.util.DistributedStopwatch.

[source, scala]
----
class DistributedStopwatch(sc: SparkContext, val name: String) {

  val elapsedTime: Accumulator[Long] = sc.accumulator(0L, s"DistributedStopwatch($name)")

  override def elapsed(): Long = elapsedTime.value

  override protected def add(duration: Long): Unit = {
    elapsedTime += duration
  }
}
