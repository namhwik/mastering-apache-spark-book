== StreamingQuery

`StreamingQuery` provides an interface for interacting with a query that executes continually in background.

NOTE: `StreamingQuery` is called *continuous query* or *stream query*.

A `StreamingQuery` has a name. It belongs to a single `SQLContext`.

NOTE: `StreamingQuery` is a Scala trait with the only implementation being link:spark-sql-streamexecution.adoc[StreamExecution]

It can be in two states: active (started) or inactive (stopped). If inactive, it may have transitioned into the state due to an `StreamingQueryException` (that is available under `exception`).

It tracks current state of all the sources, i.e. `SourceStatus`, as `sourceStatuses`.

There could only be a single link:spark-sql-streaming-sink.adoc[Sink] for a `StreamingQuery` with many `Source`'s.

`StreamingQuery` can be stopped by `stop` or an exception.
