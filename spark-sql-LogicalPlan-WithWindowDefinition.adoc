== [[WithWindowDefinition]] WithWindowDefinition Unary Logical Operator

[[windowDefinitions]][[child]]
`WithWindowDefinition` is a link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc#UnaryNode[unary logical plan] with a single `child` logical plan and a `windowDefinitions` lookup table of link:spark-sql-Expression-WindowSpecDefinition.adoc[WindowSpecDefinition] per name.

[[creating-instance]]
`WithWindowDefinition` is created exclusively when `AstBuilder` link:spark-sql-AstBuilder.adoc#withWindows[parses window definitions].

[[output]]
The link:spark-sql-catalyst-QueryPlan.adoc#output[output schema] of `WithWindowDefinition` is exactly the output attributes of the <<child, child>> logical operator.
