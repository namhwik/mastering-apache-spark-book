== [[Task]] Task

`Task` (aka _command_) is the smallest individual unit of execution that is launched to compute a link:spark-rdd-Partition.adoc[RDD partition].

.Tasks correspond to partitions in RDD
image::images/spark-rdd-partitions-job-stage-tasks.png[align="center"]

A task is described by the <<contract, Task contract>> with a single <<runTask, runTask>> method.

There are two concrete implementations of `Task` contract:

* link:spark-taskscheduler-ShuffleMapTask.adoc[ShuffleMapTask] that executes a task and divides the task's output to multiple buckets (based on the task's partitioner).
* link:spark-taskscheduler-ResultTask.adoc[ResultTask] that executes a task and sends the task's output back to the driver application.

The very last stage in a Spark job consists of multiple link:spark-taskscheduler-ResultTask.adoc[ResultTask]s, while earlier stages can only be link:spark-taskscheduler-ShuffleMapTask.adoc[ShuffleMapTask]s.

CAUTION: FIXME You could have a Spark job with link:spark-taskscheduler-ShuffleMapTask.adoc[ShuffleMapTask] being the last.

Tasks are link:spark-executor.adoc#launchTask[launched on executors] and <<run, ran when `TaskRunner` starts>>.

In other (more technical) words, a task is a computation on a data partition in a stage of a RDD in a Spark job.

NOTE: `T` is the type defined when a <<creating-instance, `Task` is created>>.

|===

A task can only belong to one stage and operate on a single partition. All tasks in a stage must be completed before the stages that follow can start.

Tasks are spawned one by one for each stage and partition.

CAUTION: FIXME What are `stageAttemptId` and `taskAttemptId`?

| [[runTask]] `runTask`

| [[preferredLocations]] `preferredLocations`
| Used exclusively in `TaskSetManager` to link:spark-TaskSetManager.adoc#addPendingTask[register a task as pending execution] and link:spark-TaskSetManager.adoc#dequeueSpeculativeTask[dequeueSpeculativeTask].

`preferredLocations` is an empty collection by default, i.e. a task has no location preferences, and so can be launched on any executor.

Set when the custom tasks, i.e. link:spark-taskscheduler-ShuffleMapTask.adoc#preferredLocations[ShuffleMapTask] and link:spark-taskscheduler-ResultTask.adoc#preferredLocations[ResultTask], are created.

=== [[attributes]] Task Attributes

A `Task` instance is uniquely identified by the following task attributes:

* `stageId` - there can be many stages in a job. Every stage has its own unique `stageId` that the task belongs to.

* `stageAttemptId` - a stage can be re-attempted for execution in case of failure. `stageAttemptId` represents the attempt id of a stage that the task belongs to.

* `partitionId` - a task is a unit of work on a partitioned distributed dataset. Every partition has its own unique `partitionId` that a task processes.

* `metrics` - an instance of link:spark-taskscheduler-taskmetrics.adoc[TaskMetrics] for the task.

* `localProperties` - local private properties of the task.

=== [[run]] Running Task Thread -- `run` Method

[source, scala]
----
run(
  taskAttemptId: Long,
  attemptNumber: Int,
  metricsSystem: MetricsSystem): T
----

`run` link:spark-blockmanager.adoc#registerTask[registers the task (identified as `taskAttemptId`) with the local `BlockManager`].

NOTE: `run` uses link:spark-sparkenv.adoc#blockManager[`SparkEnv` to access `BlockManager`].

`run` link:spark-taskscheduler-TaskContextImpl.adoc#creating-instance[creates a `TaskContextImpl`] that in turn becomes the task's link:spark-taskscheduler-taskcontext.adoc#setTaskContext[TaskContext].

NOTE: `run` is a `final` method and so must not be overriden.

`run` checks <<_killed, _killed>> flag and, if enabled, <<kill, kills the task>> (with `interruptThread` flag disabled).

`run` creates a Hadoop `CallerContext` and sets it.

`run` <<runTask, runs the task>>.

NOTE: This is the moment when the custom ``Task``'s <<runTask, runTask>> is executed.

In the end, `run` link:spark-taskscheduler-TaskContextImpl.adoc#markTaskCompleted[notifies `TaskContextImpl` that the task has completed] (regardless of the final outcome -- a success or a failure).

In case of any exceptions, `run` link:spark-taskscheduler-TaskContextImpl.adoc#markTaskFailed[notifies `TaskContextImpl` that the task has failed]. `run` link:spark-MemoryStore.adoc#releaseUnrollMemoryForThisTask[requests `MemoryStore` to release unroll memory for this task] (for both `ON_HEAP` and `OFF_HEAP` memory modes).

NOTE: `run` uses link:spark-sparkenv.adoc#blockManager[`SparkEnv` to access `BlockManager`] that it uses to access link:spark-blockmanager.adoc#memoryStore[MemoryStore].

`run` link:spark-MemoryManager.adoc[requests `MemoryManager` to notify any tasks waiting for execution memory to be freed to wake up and try to acquire memory again].

`run` link:spark-taskscheduler-taskcontext.adoc#unset[unsets the task's `TaskContext`].

NOTE: `run` uses link:spark-sparkenv.adoc#memoryManager[`SparkEnv` to access `MemoryManager`].

NOTE: `run` is used exclusively when link:spark-executor-TaskRunner.adoc#run[`TaskRunner` starts]. The `Task` instance has just been deserialized from `taskBytes` that were sent over the wire to an executor. `localProperties` and link:spark-taskscheduler-taskmemorymanager.adoc[TaskMemoryManager] are already assigned.

=== [[states]] Task States

A task can be in one of the following states:

* `LAUNCHING`
* `RUNNING` when the task is being started.
* `FINISHED` when the task finished with the serialized result.
* `FAILED` when the task fails, e.g. when link:spark-TaskRunner-FetchFailedException.adoc[FetchFailedException], `CommitDeniedException` or any `Throwable` occurs
* `KILLED` when an executor kills a task.
* `LOST`

States are the values of `org.apache.spark.TaskState`.

NOTE: Task status updates are sent from executors to the driver through link:spark-ExecutorBackend.adoc[ExecutorBackend].

Task is finished when it is in one of `FINISHED`, `FAILED`, `KILLED`, `LOST`

`LOST` and `FAILED` states are considered failures.

TIP: Task states correspond to https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/include/mesos/mesos.proto[org.apache.mesos.Protos.TaskState].

=== [[collectAccumulatorUpdates]] Collect Latest Values of Accumulators -- `collectAccumulatorUpdates` Method

[source, scala]
----
collectAccumulatorUpdates(taskFailed: Boolean = false): Seq[AccumulableInfo]
----

`collectAccumulatorUpdates` collects the latest values of accumulators used in a task (and returns the values as a collection of link:spark-accumulators.adoc#AccumulableInfo[AccumulableInfo]).

NOTE: `collectAccumulatorUpdates` is used when link:spark-executor-TaskRunner.adoc#run[`TaskRunner` runs a task] (and sends a task's final results).

When `taskFailed` is `true` it filters out link:spark-accumulators.adoc[accumulators] with `countFailedValues` disabled.

CAUTION: FIXME Why is the check `context != null`?

NOTE: It uses `context.taskMetrics.accumulatorUpdates()`.

CAUTION: FIXME What is `context.taskMetrics.accumulatorUpdates()` doing?

=== [[kill]] Killing Task -- `kill` Method

[source, scala]
----
kill(interruptThread: Boolean)
----

`kill` marks the task to be killed, i.e. it sets the internal `_killed` flag to `true`.

`kill` calls link:spark-taskscheduler-TaskContextImpl.adoc#markInterrupted[TaskContextImpl.markInterrupted] when `context` is set.

If `interruptThread` is enabled and the internal `taskThread` is available, `kill` interrupts it.

CAUTION: FIXME When could `context` and `interruptThread` not be set?
