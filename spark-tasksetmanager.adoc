== [[TaskSetManager]] TaskSetManager

A `TaskSetManager` is a <<schedulable, Schedulable>> that manages execution of the tasks in a single link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet] (after having it been handed over by link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc[TaskScheduler]).

.TaskSetManager and its Dependencies
image::images/TaskSetManager-TaskSchedulerImpl-TaskSet.png[align="center"]

The responsibilities of a `TaskSetManager` include (follow along the links to learn more in the corresponding sections):

* <<scheduling-tasks, Scheduling the tasks in a taskset>>
* <<task-retries, Retrying tasks on failure>>
* <<locality-aware-scheduling, Locality-aware scheduling via delay scheduling>>

[TIP]
====
Enable `DEBUG` logging level for `org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSetManager` logger to see what happens under the covers in TaskSetManager.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSetManager=DEBUG
```

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[schedulable]] TaskSetManager is Schedulable

`TaskSetManager` is a link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc[Schedulable] with the following implementation:

* `name` is `TaskSet_[taskSet.stageId.toString]`
* no `parent` is ever assigned, i.e. it is always `null`.
+
It means that it can only be a leaf in the tree of Schedulables (with link:spark-taskscheduler-pool.adoc[Pools] being the nodes).

* `schedulingMode` always returns `SchedulingMode.NONE` (since there is nothing to schedule).
* `weight` is always `1`.
* `minShare` is always `0`.
* `runningTasks` is the number of running tasks in the internal  `runningTasksSet`.
* `priority` is the priority of the owned link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet] (using `taskSet.priority`).
* `stageId` is the stage id of the owned link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet] (using `taskSet.stageId`).

* `schedulableQueue` returns no queue, i.e. `null`.
* `addSchedulable` and `removeSchedulable` do nothing.
* `getSchedulableByName` always returns `null`.

* `getSortedTaskSetQueue` returns a one-element collection with the sole element being itself.

* <<executorLost, executorLost>>
* <<checkSpeculatableTasks, checkSpeculatableTasks>>

=== [[executorLost]] Handling Executor Lost Events (executorLost method)

NOTE: `executorLost` is part of the link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc#contract[Schedulable Contract] which is called by link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#removeExecutor[TaskSchedulerImpl] to inform `TaskSetManagers` about executors being lost.

Since `TaskSetManager` manages execution of the tasks in a single link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet], when an executor gets lost, the affected tasks that have been running on the failed executor need to be re-enqueued. `executorLost` is the mechanism to "announce" the event to all `TaskSetManagers`.

`executorLost` first checks whether the `TaskSet` is for a link:spark-dagscheduler-ShuffleMapStage.adoc[ShuffleMapStage] (in which case all `TaskSet.tasks` are instances of link:spark-taskscheduler-tasks.adoc#shufflemaptask[ShuffleMapTask]) as well as whether an link:spark-ExternalShuffleService.adoc[external shuffle server] is used (that could serve the shuffle outputs in case of failure).

If it is indeed for a failed link:spark-dagscheduler-ShuffleMapStage.adoc[ShuffleMapStage] and no external shuffle server is enabled, all successfully-completed tasks for the failed executor (using `taskInfos` <<internal-registries, internal registry>>) <<addPendingTask, get added to the collection of pending tasks>> and the link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#taskEnded[DAGScheduler is informed about resubmission] (as link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#TaskEndReason-Resubmitted[`Resubmitted` end reason]).

The <<internal-registries, internal registries>> - `successful`, `copiesRunning`, and `tasksSuccessful` - are updated.

Regardless of the above check, all currently-running tasks for the failed executor are <<handleFailedTask, reported as failed>> (with the task state being `FAILED`).

<<recomputeLocality, recomputeLocality>> is called.

=== [[checkSpeculatableTasks]] Checking Speculatable Tasks (checkSpeculatableTasks method)

NOTE: `checkSpeculatableTasks` is part of the link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc#contract[Schedulable Contract].

`checkSpeculatableTasks` checks whether there are speculatable tasks in the TaskSet.

NOTE: `checkSpeculatableTasks` is called by link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#speculative-execution[TaskSchedulerImpl.checkSpeculatableTasks].

If the TaskSetManager is <<zombie-state, zombie>> or has a single task in TaskSet, it assumes no speculatable tasks.

The method goes on with the assumption of no speculatable tasks by default.

It computes the minimum number of finished tasks for speculation (as <<settings, spark.speculation.quantile>> of all the finished tasks).

You should see the DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG Checking for speculative tasks: minFinished = [minFinishedForSpeculation]
```

It then checks whether the number is equal or greater than the number of tasks completed successfully (using `tasksSuccessful`).

Having done that, it computes the median duration of all the successfully completed tasks (using `taskInfos`) and task length threshold using the median duration multiplied by <<settings, spark.speculation.multiplier>> that has to be equal or less than `100`.

You should see the DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG Task length threshold for speculation: [threshold]
```

For each task (using `taskInfos`) that is not marked as successful yet (using `successful`) for which there is only one copy running (using `copiesRunning`) and the task takes more time than the calculated threshold, but it was not in `speculatableTasks` it is assumed *speculatable*.

You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO Marking task [index] in stage [taskSet.id] (on [info.host]) as speculatable because it ran more than [threshold] ms
```

The task gets added to the internal `speculatableTasks` collection. The method responds positively.

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[dequeueSpeculativeTask]] dequeueSpeculativeTask

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[dequeueTask]] dequeueTask

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[executorAdded]] TaskSetManager.executorAdded

`executorAdded` simply calls <<recomputeLocality, recomputeLocality>> method.

=== [[recomputeLocality]] TaskSetManager.recomputeLocality

`recomputeLocality` (re)computes locality levels as a indexed collection of task localities, i.e. `Array[TaskLocality.TaskLocality]`.

NOTE: `TaskLocality` is an enumeration with `PROCESS_LOCAL`, `NODE_LOCAL`, `NO_PREF`, `RACK_LOCAL`, `ANY` values.

The method starts with `currentLocalityIndex` being `0`.

It checks whether `pendingTasksForExecutor` has at least one element, and if so, it looks up <<settings, spark.locality.wait.*>> for `PROCESS_LOCAL` and checks whether there is an executor for which `TaskSchedulerImpl.isExecutorAlive` is `true`. If the checks pass, `PROCESS_LOCAL` becomes an element of the result collection of task localities.

The same checks are performed for `pendingTasksForHost`, `NODE_LOCAL`, and `TaskSchedulerImpl.hasExecutorsAliveOnHost` to add `NODE_LOCAL` to the result collection of task localities.

Then, the method checks `pendingTasksWithNoPrefs` and if it's not empty, `NO_PREF` becomes an element of the levels collection.

If `pendingTasksForRack` is not empty, and the wait time for `RACK_LOCAL` is defined, and there is an executor for which `TaskSchedulerImpl.hasHostAliveOnRack` is `true`, `RACK_LOCAL` is added to the levels collection.

`ANY` is the last and always-added element in the levels collection.

Right before the method finishes, it prints out the following DEBUG to the logs:

```
DEBUG Valid locality levels for [taskSet]: [levels]
```

`myLocalityLevels`, `localityWaits`, and `currentLocalityIndex` are recomputed.

=== [[resourceOffer]] TaskSetManager.resourceOffer

CAUTION: FIXME Review `TaskSetManager.resourceOffer` + Does this have anything related to the following section about scheduling tasks?

[source, scala]
----
resourceOffer(
  execId: String,
  host: String,
  maxLocality: TaskLocality): Option[TaskDescription]
----

When a `TaskSetManager` is a <<zombie-state, zombie>>, `resourceOffer` returns no `TaskDescription` (i.e. `None`).

For a non-zombie `TaskSetManager`, `resourceOffer`...FIXME

CAUTION: FIXME

It dequeues a pending task from the taskset by checking pending tasks per executor (using `pendingTasksForExecutor`), host (using `pendingTasksForHost`), with no localization preferences (using `pendingTasksWithNoPrefs`), rack (uses `TaskSchedulerImpl.getRackForHost` that seems to return "non-zero" value for link:yarn/spark-yarn-yarnscheduler.adoc[YarnScheduler] only)

From `TaskSetManager.resourceOffer`:

```
INFO TaskSetManager: Starting task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0, 192.168.1.4, partition 0,PROCESS_LOCAL, 1997 bytes)
```

If a serialized task is bigger than `100` kB (it is not a configurable value), a WARN message is printed out to the logs (only once per taskset):

```
WARN TaskSetManager: Stage [task.stageId] contains a task of very large size ([serializedTask.limit / 1024] KB). The maximum recommended task size is 100 KB.
```

A task id is added to `runningTasksSet` set and <<parent-pool, parent pool>> notified (using `increaseRunningTasks(1)` up the chain of pools).

The following INFO message appears in the logs:

```
INFO TaskSetManager: Starting task [id] in stage [taskSet.id] (TID [taskId], [host], partition [task.partitionId],[taskLocality], [serializedTask.limit] bytes)
```

For example:

```
INFO TaskSetManager: Starting task 1.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 1, localhost, partition 1,PROCESS_LOCAL, 2054 bytes)
```

=== [[scheduling-tasks]] Scheduling Tasks in TaskSet

CAUTION: FIXME

For each submitted <<taskset, TaskSet>>, a new TaskSetManager is created. The TaskSetManager completely and exclusively owns a TaskSet submitted for execution.

CAUTION: FIXME A picture with TaskSetManager owning TaskSet

CAUTION: FIXME What component knows about TaskSet and TaskSetManager. Isn't it that TaskSets are *created* by  DAGScheduler while TaskSetManager is used by TaskSchedulerImpl only?

TaskSetManager requests the current epoch from link:spark-service-mapoutputtracker.adoc[MapOutputTracker] and sets it on all tasks in the taskset.

You should see the following DEBUG in the logs:

```
DEBUG Epoch for [taskSet]: [epoch]
```

CAUTION: FIXME What's epoch. Why is this important?

TaskSetManager keeps track of the tasks pending execution per executor, host, rack or with no locality preferences.

=== [[locality-aware-scheduling]] Locality-Aware Scheduling aka Delay Scheduling

TaskSetManager computes locality levels for the TaskSet for delay scheduling. While computing you should see the following DEBUG in the logs:

```
DEBUG Valid locality levels for [taskSet]:  [levels]
```

CAUTION: FIXME What's delay scheduling?

=== [[events]] Events

When a task has finished, the `TaskSetManager` calls link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#CompletionEvent[DAGScheduler.taskEnded].

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[handleSuccessfulTask]] TaskSetManager.handleSuccessfulTask

`handleSuccessfulTask(tid: Long, result: DirectTaskResult[_])` method marks the task (by `tid`) as successful and notifies the DAGScheduler that the task has ended.

It is called by... when...FIXME

CAUTION: FIXME Describe `TaskInfo`

It marks `TaskInfo` (using `taskInfos`) as successful (using `TaskInfo.markSuccessful()`).

It removes the task from `runningTasksSet`. It also decreases the number of running tasks in the parent pool if it is defined (using `parent` and `Pool.decreaseRunningTasks`).

It notifies DAGScheduler that the task ended successfully (using link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#CompletionEvent[DAGScheduler.taskEnded] with `Success` as `TaskEndReason`).

If the task was not marked as successful already (using `successful`), `tasksSuccessful` is incremented and the following INFO message appears in the logs:

```
INFO Finished task [info.id] in stage [taskSet.id] (TID [info.taskId]) in [info.duration] ms on [info.host] ([tasksSuccessful]/[numTasks])
```

NOTE: A TaskSet knows about the stage id it is associated with.

It also marks the task as successful (using `successful`). Finally, if the number of tasks finished successfully is exactly the number of tasks the TaskSetManager manages, the TaskSetManager turns zombie.

Otherwise, when the task was already marked as successful, the following INFO message appears in the logs:

```
INFO Ignoring task-finished event for [info.id] in stage [taskSet.id] because task [index] has already completed successfully
```

`failedExecutors.remove(index)` is called.

CAUTION: FIXME What does `failedExecutors.remove(index)` mean?

At the end, the method checks whether the TaskSetManager is a zombie and no task is running (using `runningTasksSet`), and if so, it calls link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#taskSetFinished[TaskSchedulerImpl.taskSetFinished].

=== [[handleFailedTask]] TaskSetManager.handleFailedTask

`handleFailedTask(tid: Long, state: TaskState, reason: TaskEndReason)` method is called by link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#handleFailedTask[TaskSchedulerImpl] or <<executorLost, executorLost>>.

CAUTION: FIXME image with `handleFailedTask` (and perhaps the other parties involved)

The method first checks whether the task has already been marked as failed (using <<internal-registries, taskInfos>>) and if it has, it quits.

It removes the task from <<internal-registries, runningTasksSet>> and informs <<internal-registries, the parent pool>> to decrease its running tasks.

It marks the TaskInfo as failed and grabs its index so the number of copies running of the task is decremented (see <<internal-registries, copiesRunning>>).

CAUTION: FIXME Describe `TaskInfo`

The method calculates the failure exception to report per `TaskEndReason`. See below for the possible cases of TaskEndReason.

CAUTION: FIXME Describe `TaskEndReason`.

The executor for the failed task is added to <<internal-registries, failedExecutors>>.

It informs DAGScheduler that the task ended (using  link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#CompletionEvent[DAGScheduler.taskEnded]).

The task is then added to the list of pending tasks.

If the TaskSetManager is not a <<zombie-state, zombie>>, and the task was not `KILLED`, and the task failure should be counted towards the maximum number of times the task is allowed to fail before the stage is aborted (`TaskFailedReason.countTowardsTaskFailures` is `true`), <<internal-registries, numFailures>> is incremented and if the number of failures of the task equals or is greater than assigned to the TaskSetManager (`maxTaskFailures`), the ERROR appears in the logs:

```
ERROR Task [id] in stage [id] failed [maxTaskFailures] times; aborting job
```

And <<aborting-taskset, abort>> is called, and the method quits.

Otherwise, `TaskSchedulerImpl.taskSetFinished` is called when the TaskSetManager is <<zombie-state, zombie>> and there are no running tasks.

==== FetchFailed

For `FetchFailed`, it logs WARNING:

```
WARNING Lost task [id] in stage [id] (TID [id], [host]): [reason.toErrorString]
```

Unless it has already been marked as successful (in <<internal-registries, successful>>), the task becomes so and <<internal-registries, tasksSuccessful>> is incremented.

The TaskSetManager becomes <<zombie-state, zombie>>.

No exception is returned.

==== ExceptionFailure

For `ExceptionFailure`, it grabs link:spark-taskscheduler-taskmetrics.adoc[TaskMetrics] if available.

If it is a `NotSerializableException`, it logs ERROR:

```
ERROR Task [id] in stage [id] (TID [tid]) had a not serializable result: [exception.description]; not retrying"
```

It calls <<aborting-taskset, abort>> and returns no failure exception.

It continues if not being a `NotSerializableException`.

It grabs the description and the time of the ExceptionFailure.

If the description, i.e. the ExceptionFailure, has already been reported (and is therefore a duplication), <<settings, spark.logging.exceptionPrintInterval>> is checked before reprinting the duplicate exception in full.

For full printout of the ExceptionFailure, the following WARNING appears in the logs:

```
WARNING Lost task [id] in stage [id] (TID [id], [host]): [reason.toErrorString]
```

Otherwise, the following INFO appears in the logs:

```
INFO Lost task [id] in stage [id] (TID [id]) on executor [host]: [ef.className] ([ef.description]) [duplicate [count]]
```

The ExceptionFailure becomes failure exception.

==== ExecutorLostFailure

For `ExecutorLostFailure` if not `exitCausedByApp`, the following INFO appears in the logs:

```
INFO Task [tid] failed because while it was being computed, its executor exited for a reason unrelated to the task. Not counting this failure towards the maximum number of failures for the task.
```

No failure exception is returned.

==== Other TaskFailedReasons

For the other TaskFailedReasons, the WARNING appears in the logs:

```
WARNING Lost task [id] in stage [id] (TID [id], [host]): [reason.toErrorString]
```

No failure exception is returned.

==== Other TaskEndReason

For the other TaskEndReasons, the ERROR appears in the logs:

```
ERROR Unknown TaskEndReason: [e]
```

No failure exception is returned.

=== [[task-retries]] Retrying Tasks on Failure

CAUTION: FIXME

Up to <<settings, spark.task.maxFailures>> attempts

=== Task retries and spark.task.maxFailures

When you start Spark program you set up <<settings, spark.task.maxFailures>> for the number of failures that are acceptable until TaskSetManager gives up and marks a job failed.

In Spark shell with local master, `spark.task.maxFailures` is fixed to `1` and you need to use link:spark-local.adoc[local-with-retries master] to change it to some other value.

In the following example, you are going to execute a job with two partitions and keep one failing at all times (by throwing an exception). The aim is to learn the behavior of retrying task execution in a stage in TaskSet. You will only look at a single task execution, namely `0.0`.

```

=== [[zombie-state]] Zombie state

TaskSetManager enters *zombie* state when all tasks in a taskset have completed successfully (regardless of the number of task attempts), or if the task set has been aborted (see <<aborting-taskset, Aborting TaskSet>>).

While in zombie state, TaskSetManager can launch no new tasks and <<resourceOffer, responds with no `TaskDescription` to resourceOffers>>.

TaskSetManager remains in the zombie state until all tasks have finished running, i.e. to continue to track and account for the running tasks.

=== [[abort]][[aborting-taskset]] Aborting TaskSet -- `abort` method

[source, scala]
----
abort(message: String, exception: Option[Throwable] = None): Unit
----

`abort` informs link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc[DAGScheduler] that the link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet] has been aborted (using `DAGScheduler.taskSetFailed` method).

CAUTION: FIXME image with DAGScheduler call

The TaskSetManager enters <<zombie-state, zombie state>>.

Finally, `maybeFinishTaskSet` method is called.

CAUTION: FIXME Why is `maybeFinishTaskSet` method called? When is `runningTasks` `0`?

=== [[canFetchMoreResults]] Checking Available Memory For Task Result -- `canFetchMoreResults` method

[source, scala]
----
canFetchMoreResults(size: Long): Boolean
----

`canFetchMoreResults` checks whether there is enough memory to fetch the result of a task.

Internally, `canFetchMoreResults` increments the internal <<totalResultSize, totalResultSize>> with the input `size` which is the result of a task. It also increments the internal <<calculatedTasks, calculatedTasks>>.

If the current internal <<totalResultSize, totalResultSize>> is bigger than  <<spark_driver_maxResultSize, spark.driver.maxResultSize>> the following ERROR message is printed out to the logs:

```
ERROR TaskSetManager: Total size of serialized results of [calculatedTasks] tasks ([totalResultSize]) is bigger than spark.driver.maxResultSize ([maxResultSize])
```

The current link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet] is <<abort, aborted>> and `canFetchMoreResults` returns `false`.

Otherwise, `canFetchMoreResults` returns `true`.

NOTE: `canFetchMoreResults` is used in link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#enqueueSuccessfulTask[TaskResultGetter.enqueueSuccessfulTask] only.

=== [[internal-registries]] Internal Registries

==== [[totalResultSize]] totalResultSize

`totalResultSize` is the current total size of the result of all the tasks that have finished.

It is increased with the size of a task result when a `TaskSetManager` <<canFetchMoreResults, checks that there is enough memory to fetch the task result>>.

==== [[calculatedTasks]] calculatedTasks

`calculatedTasks` is the number of the tasks that have already completed execution.

`calculatedTasks` is initially set to `0` when a <<creating-instance, `TaskSetManager` is created>> and is only incremented when the <<canFetchMoreResults, `TaskSetManager` checks that there is enough memory to fetch a task result>>.

==== Others

* `copiesRunning`
* `successful`
* `numFailures`
* `failedExecutors` contains a mapping of TaskInfo's indices that failed to executor ids and the time of the failure. It is used in <<handleFailedTask, handleFailedTask>>.

=== [[settings]] Settings

* `spark.scheduler.executorTaskBlacklistTime` (default: `0L`) - time interval to pass after which a task can be re-launched on the executor where it has once failed. It is to prevent repeated task failures due to executor failures.
* `spark.speculation` (default: `false`)
* `spark.speculation.quantile` (default: `0.75`) - the percentage of tasks that has not finished yet at which to start speculation.

* `spark.logging.exceptionPrintInterval` (default: `10000`) - how frequently to reprint duplicate exceptions in full, in milliseconds
* `spark.locality.wait` (default: `3s`) - for locality-aware delay scheduling for `PROCESS_LOCAL`, `NODE_LOCAL`, and `RACK_LOCAL` when locality-specific setting is not set.
* `spark.locality.wait.process` (default: the value of `spark.locality.wait`) - delay for `PROCESS_LOCAL`
* `spark.locality.wait.node` (default: the value of `spark.locality.wait`) - delay for `NODE_LOCAL`
* `spark.locality.wait.rack` (default: the value of `spark.locality.wait`) - delay for `RACK_LOCAL`

==== [[spark_driver_maxResultSize]] spark.driver.maxResultSize

`spark.driver.maxResultSize` (default: `1g`) sets the quota to fetch the results, i.e. limit of bytes for total size of results.

If the value is smaller than `1m` or `1048576` (1024 * 1024), it becomes 0.

NOTE: It is used in `TaskSetManager.canFetchMoreResults` and `Utils.getMaxResultSize`.
