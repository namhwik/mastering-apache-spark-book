== [[JobListener]] JobListener and JobWaiter

Spark subscribes for job completion or failure events (after submitting a job to link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc[DAGScheduler]) using `JobListener` trait.

The following are the job listeners used:

1. <<JobWaiter, JobWaiter>> waits until link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc[DAGScheduler] completes a job and passes the results of tasks to a `resultHandler` function.
2. `ApproximateActionListener`...FIXME

An instance of `JobListener` is used in the following places:

* In `ActiveJob` as a listener to notify if tasks in this job finish or the job fails.
* In `DAGScheduler.handleJobSubmitted`
* In `DAGScheduler.handleMapStageSubmitted`
* In `JobSubmitted`
* In `MapStageSubmitted`

=== [[contract]][[taskSucceeded]][[jobFailed]] `JobListener` Contract

`JobListener` is a `private[spark]` contract with the following two methods:

[source, scala]
----
private[spark] trait JobListener {
  def taskSucceeded(index: Int, result: Any)
  def jobFailed(exception: Exception)
}
----

A `JobListener` object is notified each time a task succeeds (by `taskSucceeded`) and when the whole job fails (by `jobFailed`).

=== [[JobWaiter]] JobWaiter

[source, scala]
----
JobWaiter[T](
  dagScheduler: DAGScheduler,
  val jobId: Int,
  totalTasks: Int,
  resultHandler: (Int, T) => Unit)
extends JobListener
----

`JobWaiter` is a custom <<JobListener, JobListener>>.

It is used when `DAGScheduler` link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#submitJob[submits a job] or link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#submitMapStage[submits a map stage]. You can use a `JobWaiter` to block until the job finishes executing or to cancel it.

While the methods execute, link:spark-dagscheduler-DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop.adoc#JobSubmitted[`JobSubmitted`] and link:spark-dagscheduler-DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop.adoc#MapStageSubmitted[MapStageSubmitted] events are posted that reference the `JobWaiter`.

As a `JobListener`, `JobWaiter` gets notified about task completions or failures, using `taskSucceeded` and `jobFailed`, respectively. When the total number of tasks (that equals the number of partitions to compute) equals the number of `taskSucceeded`, the `JobWaiter` instance is marked successful. A `jobFailed` event marks the `JobWaiter` instance failed.
