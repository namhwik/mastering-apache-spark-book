== [[AggregateExpression]] AggregateExpression -- Expression Container for AggregateFunction

`AggregateExpression` is an link:spark-sql-Expression.adoc#Unevaluable[unevaluable expression] (i.e. with no support for `eval` and `doGenCode` methods) that acts as a container for an <<aggregateFunction, AggregateFunction>>.

`AggregateExpression` contains the following:

* [[aggregateFunction]] link:spark-sql-Expression-AggregateFunction.adoc[AggregateFunction]
* [[mode]] `AggregateMode`
* [[isDistinct]] `isDistinct` flag indicating whether this aggregation is distinct or not (e.g. whether SQL's `DISTINCT` keyword was used for the <<aggregateFunction, aggregate function>>)
* [[resultId]] `ExprId`

`AggregateExpression` is created when:

* `Analyzer` link:spark-sql-Analyzer.adoc#ResolveFunctions[resolves AggregateFunctions] (and creates an `AggregateExpression` with `Complete` aggregate mode for the functions)

* `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` is created with `isDistinct` flag link:spark-sql-UserDefinedAggregateFunction.adoc#apply[disabled] or link:spark-sql-UserDefinedAggregateFunction.adoc#distinct[enabled]

* link:spark-sql-SparkStrategy-Aggregation.adoc#planAggregateWithOneDistinct[AggUtils.planAggregateWithOneDistinct] (and creates `AggregateExpressions` with `Partial` and `Final` aggregate modes for the functions)

* `Aggregator` is requested for a `TypedColumn` (using `Aggregator.toColumn`)

* `AggregateFunction` is link:spark-sql-Expression-AggregateFunction.adoc#toAggregateExpression[wrapped in a AggregateExpression]
