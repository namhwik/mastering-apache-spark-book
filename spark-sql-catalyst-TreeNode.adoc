== [[TreeNode]] TreeNode

`TreeNode` is the foundation of link:spark-sql-catalyst.adoc[Catalyst].

Scala-specific, `TreeNode` is an abstract class that is the base class of link:spark-sql-catalyst-QueryPlan.adoc[QueryPlan] and link:spark-sql-catalyst-Expression.adoc[Expression] abstract classes.

TIP: `TreeNode` abstract type is a quite advanced Scala type definition (at least comparing to the other Scala types in Spark) so understanding its behaviour even outside Spark might be worthwhile by itself.

`TreeNode` can have `children` and offers not only functions that you may have used from Scala Collection API, e.g. `foreach`, `map`, `flatMap`, `collect`, `collectFirst`, but also `foreachUp`, `mapChildren`, `transform`, `transformDown`, `transformUp`, etc. that are particularly useful for tree manipulation.
