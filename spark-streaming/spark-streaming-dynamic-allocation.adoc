== Elastic Scaling (Dynamic Allocation)

*Dynamic Allocation* in Spark Streaming makes for *adaptive streaming applications* by scaling them up and down to adapt to load variations. It actively controls resources (as executors) and prevents resources from being wasted when the processing time is short (comparing to a batch interval) - *scale down* - or adds new executors to decrease the processing time - *scale up*.

NOTE: It is a work in progress in Spark Streaming and should be available in Spark 2.0.

The motivation is to control the number of executors required to process input records when their number increases to the point when the link:spark-streaming-webui.adoc#processing-time[processing time] could become longer than the link:spark-streaming.adoc#batch-interval[batch interval].

=== Configuration

* `spark.streaming.dynamicAllocation.enabled` controls whether to enabled dynamic allocation (`true`) or not (`false`).
