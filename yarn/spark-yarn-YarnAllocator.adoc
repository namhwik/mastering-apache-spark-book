== YarnAllocator -- Container Allocator

`YarnAllocator` <<allocateResources, allocates resource containers>> from link:spark-yarn-introduction.adoc#ResourceManager[YARN ResourceManager] to run Spark executors on and <<internalReleaseContainer, releases them>> when the Spark application no longer needs them.

It talks directly to YARN ResourceManager through the `amClient` reference (of YARN's https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/client/api/AMRMClient.html[AMRMClient[ContainerRequest\]] type) that it gets when <<creating-instance, created>> (from link:spark-yarn-yarnrmclient.adoc#register[`YarnRMClient` when it registers the ApplicationMaster for a Spark application]).

CAUTION: FIXME Image for YarnAllocator uses amClient Reference to YARN ResourceManager

`YarnAllocator` is a part of the internal state of link:spark-yarn-applicationmaster.adoc#allocator[ApplicationMaster] (via the internal `allocator` reference).

.ApplicationMaster uses YarnAllocator (via allocator attribute)
image::../images/spark-yarn-YarnAllocator.png[align="center"]

When `YarnAllocator` is <<creating-instance, created>>, it requires `driverUrl`, Hadoop's https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/conf/Configuration.html[Configuration], a link:spark-configuration.adoc[Spark configuration], YARN's https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api/records/ApplicationAttemptId.html[ApplicationAttemptId], a link:spark-security.adoc#SecurityManager[SecurityManager], and a collection of Hadoop's https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api/records/LocalResource.html[LocalResources] by their name. The parameters are later used for <<runAllocatedContainers, launching Spark executors in allocated YARN containers>>.

CAUTION: FIXME An image with YarnAllocator and multiple ExecutorRunnables.

[TIP]
====
Enable `INFO` or `DEBUG` logging level for `org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnAllocator` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnAllocator=DEBUG
```

Refer to link:spark-logging.adoc[Logging].

=== [[creating-instance]] Creating YarnAllocator Instance

When link:spark-yarn-yarnrmclient.adoc#register[`YarnRMClient` registers `ApplicationMaster` for a Spark application (with YARN ResourceManager)] it creates a new `YarnAllocator` instance.

.Creating YarnAllocator
image::../images/spark-yarn-YarnAllocator-amClient-ResourceManager.png[align="center"]

All the input parameters for `YarnAllocator` (but `appAttemptId` and `amClient`) are passed directly from the input parameters of `YarnRMClient`.

[source, scala]
----
YarnAllocator(
  driverUrl: String,
  driverRef: RpcEndpointRef,
  conf: Configuration,
  sparkConf: SparkConf,
  amClient: AMRMClient[ContainerRequest],
  appAttemptId: ApplicationAttemptId,
  securityMgr: SecurityManager,
  localResources: Map[String, LocalResource])
----

The input `amClient` parameter is created in and owned by `YarnRMClient`.

When `YarnAllocator` is created, it sets the `org.apache.hadoop.yarn.util.RackResolver` logger to `WARN` (unless set to some log level already).

It creates the following empty registries:

* <<releasedContainers, releasedContainers>>
* <<allocatedHostToContainersMap, allocatedHostToContainersMap>>
* <<allocatedContainerToHostMap, allocatedContainerToHostMap>>
* <<pendingLossReasonRequests, pendingLossReasonRequests>>
* <<releasedExecutorLossReasons, releasedExecutorLossReasons>>
* <<executorIdToContainer, executorIdToContainer>>
* <<containerIdToExecutorId, containerIdToExecutorId>>
* <<hostToLocalTaskCounts, hostToLocalTaskCounts>>

It sets the following internal counters:

* `numExecutorsRunning` to `0`
* `executorIdCounter` to the  link:spark-yarn-cluster-YarnSchedulerEndpoint.adoc#RetrieveLastAllocatedExecutorId[last allocated executor id] (it seems quite an extensive operation that uses a RPC system)
* `numUnexpectedContainerRelease` to `0L`
* `numLocalityAwareTasks` to `0`
* `targetNumExecutors` to link:spark-yarn-YarnSparkHadoopUtil.adoc#getInitialTargetExecutorNumber[the initial number of executors]

It creates an empty <<failedExecutorsTimeStamps, queue of failed executors>>.

It sets the internal `executorFailuresValidityInterval` to link:spark-yarn-settings.adoc#spark.yarn.executor.failuresValidityInterval[spark.yarn.executor.failuresValidityInterval].

It sets the internal `executorMemory` to link:spark-executor.adoc#spark_executor_memory[spark.executor.memory].

It sets the internal `memoryOverhead` to link:spark-yarn-settings.adoc#spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead[spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead]. If unavailable, it is set to the maximum of 10% of `executorMemory` and `384`.

It sets the internal `executorCores` to link:spark-executor.adoc#spark_executor_cores[spark.executor.cores].

It creates the internal `resource` to Hadoop YARN's https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api/records/Resource.html[Resource] with both `executorMemory + memoryOverhead` memory and `executorCores` CPU cores.

It creates the internal `launcherPool` called *ContainerLauncher* with maximum link:spark-yarn-settings.adoc#spark.yarn.containerLauncherMaxThreads[spark.yarn.containerLauncherMaxThreads] threads.

It sets the internal `launchContainers` to link:spark-yarn-settings.adoc#spark.yarn.launchContainers[spark.yarn.launchContainers].

It sets the internal `labelExpression` to link:spark-yarn-settings.adoc#spark.yarn.executor.nodeLabelExpression[spark.yarn.executor.nodeLabelExpression].

It sets the internal `nodeLabelConstructor` to...FIXME

CAUTION: FIXME nodeLabelConstructor?

It sets the internal `containerPlacementStrategy` to...FIXME

CAUTION: FIXME LocalityPreferredContainerPlacementStrategy?

=== [[requestTotalExecutorsWithPreferredLocalities]] Requesting Executors with Locality Preferences (requestTotalExecutorsWithPreferredLocalities method)

[source, scala]
----
requestTotalExecutorsWithPreferredLocalities(
  requestedTotal: Int,
  localityAwareTasks: Int,
  hostToLocalTaskCount: Map[String, Int]): Boolean
----

`requestTotalExecutorsWithPreferredLocalities` returns `true` if the <<targetNumExecutors, current desired total number of executors>> is different than the input `requestedTotal`.

NOTE: `requestTotalExecutorsWithPreferredLocalities` should instead have been called `shouldRequestTotalExecutorsWithPreferredLocalities` since it answers the question whether to request total executors or not.

`requestTotalExecutorsWithPreferredLocalities` sets the internal <<numLocalityAwareTasks, numLocalityAwareTasks>> and <<hostToLocalTaskCounts, hostToLocalTaskCounts>> attributes to the input `localityAwareTasks` and `hostToLocalTaskCount` arguments, respectively.

If the input `requestedTotal` is different than the internal `targetNumExecutors` attribute you should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO YarnAllocator: Driver requested a total number of [requestedTotal] executor(s).
```

It sets the internal `targetNumExecutors` attribute to the input `requestedTotal` and returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

NOTE: `requestTotalExecutorsWithPreferredLocalities` is executed in response to link:spark-yarn-AMEndpoint.adoc#RequestExecutors[`RequestExecutors` message to `ApplicationMaster`].

=== [[numLocalityAwareTasks]] numLocalityAwareTasks Internal Counter

[source, scala]
----
numLocalityAwareTasks: Int = 0
----

It tracks the number of locality-aware tasks to be used as container placement hint when <<requestTotalExecutorsWithPreferredLocalities, `YarnAllocator` is requested for executors given locality preferences>>.

It is used as an input to `containerPlacementStrategy.localityOfRequestedContainers` when <<updateResourceRequests, `YarnAllocator` updates YARN container allocation requests>>.

=== [[updateResourceRequests]] Adding or Removing Executor Container Requests (updateResourceRequests method)

[source, scala]
----
updateResourceRequests(): Unit
----

`updateResourceRequests` <<updateResourceRequests-missing-executors, requests new>> or <<updateResourceRequests-cancelling-executor-allocations, cancels outstanding>> executor containers from the link:spark-yarn-introduction.adoc#ResourceManager[YARN ResourceManager].

NOTE: In YARN, you have to request containers for resources first (using link:++https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/client/api/AMRMClient.html#addContainerRequest(T)++[AMRMClient.addContainerRequest]) before calling link:++https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/client/api/AMRMClient.html#allocate(float)++[AMRMClient.allocate].

It gets the list of outstanding YARN's `ContainerRequests` (using the constructor's link:++https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/client/api/AMRMClient.html#getMatchingRequests(org.apache.hadoop.yarn.api.records.Priority, java.lang.String, org.apache.hadoop.yarn.api.records.Resource)++[AMRMClient[ContainerRequest\]]) and aligns their number to current workload.

`updateResourceRequests` consists of two main branches:

1. <<updateResourceRequests-missing-executors, missing executors>>, i.e. when the number of executors allocated already or pending does not match the needs and so there are missing executors.

2. <<updateResourceRequests-cancelling-executor-allocations, executors to cancel>>, i.e. when the number of pending executor allocations is positive, but the number of all the executors is more than Spark needs.

==== [[updateResourceRequests-missing-executors]] Case 1. Missing Executors

You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO YarnAllocator: Will request [count] executor containers, each with [vCores] cores and [memory] MB memory including [memoryOverhead] MB overhead
```

It then splits pending container allocation requests per locality preference of pending tasks (in the internal <<hostToLocalTaskCounts, hostToLocalTaskCounts>> registry).

CAUTION: FIXME Review `splitPendingAllocationsByLocality`

It removes stale container allocation requests (using YARN's link:++https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/client/api/AMRMClient.html#removeContainerRequest(T)++[AMRMClient.removeContainerRequest]).

CAUTION: FIXME Stale?

You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO YarnAllocator: Canceled [cancelledContainers] container requests (locality no longer needed)
```

It computes locality of requested containers (based on the internal <<numLocalityAwareTasks, numLocalityAwareTasks>>, <<hostToLocalTaskCounts, hostToLocalTaskCounts>> and <<allocatedHostToContainersMap, allocatedHostToContainersMap>> lookup table).

CAUTION: FIXME Review `containerPlacementStrategy.localityOfRequestedContainers` + the code that follows.

For any new container needed `updateResourceRequests` adds a container request (using YARN's link:++https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/client/api/AMRMClient.html#addContainerRequest(T)++[AMRMClient.addContainerRequest]).

You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO YarnAllocator: Submitted container request (host: [host], capability: [resource])
```

==== [[updateResourceRequests-cancelling-executor-allocations]] Case 2. Cancelling Pending Executor Allocations

When there are executors to cancel (case 2.), you should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO Canceling requests for [numToCancel] executor container(s) to have a new desired total [targetNumExecutors] executors.
```

It checks whether there are pending allocation requests and removes the excess (using YARN's link:++https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/client/api/AMRMClient.html#removeContainerRequest(T)++[AMRMClient.removeContainerRequest]). If there are no pending allocation requests, you should see the WARN message in the logs:

```
WARN Expected to find pending requests, but found none.
```

=== [[killExecutor]] killExecutor

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[handleAllocatedContainers]] Handling Allocated Containers for Executors (handleAllocatedContainers internal method)

When the link:spark-yarn-introduction.adoc#ResourceManager[YARN ResourceManager] has allocated new containers for executors in <<allocateResources, allocateResources>>, the call is then passed on to `handleAllocatedContainers` procedure.

[source, scala]
----
handleAllocatedContainers(allocatedContainers: Seq[Container]): Unit
----

`handleAllocatedContainers` handles allocated YARN containers.

Internally, `handleAllocatedContainers` <<matchContainerToRequest, matches requests to host, rack, and any host (a container allocation)>>.

If there are any allocated containers left (without having been matched), you should see the following DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG Releasing [size] unneeded containers that were allocated to us
```

It then <<internalReleaseContainer, releases the containers>>.

It <<runAllocatedContainers, runs the allocated and matched containers>>.

At the end of the method, you should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO Received [allocatedContainersSize] containers from YARN, launching executors on [containersToUseSize] of them.
```

==== [[runAllocatedContainers]] Launching Spark Executors in Allocated YARN Containers (runAllocatedContainers internal method)

[source, scala]
----
runAllocatedContainers(containersToUse: ArrayBuffer[Container]): Unit
----

For each YARN's https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api/records/Container.html[Container] in the input `containersToUse` collection, `runAllocatedContainers` attempts to run a link:spark-yarn-ExecutorRunnable.adoc[ExecutorRunnable] (on <<launcherPool, ContainerLauncher thread pool>>).

Internally, `runAllocatedContainers` increases the internal `executorIdCounter` counter and asserts that the amount of memory of (the resource allocated to) the container is greater than the requested memory for executors.

You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO YarnAllocator: Launching container [containerId] for on host [executorHostname]
```

Unless `runAllocatedContainers` runs in link:spark-yarn-settings.adoc#spark.yarn.launchContainers[spark.yarn.launchContainers] testing mode (when it merely <<updateInternalState, updates internal state>>), you should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO YarnAllocator: Launching ExecutorRunnable. driverUrl: [driverUrl],  executorHostname: [executorHostname]
```

NOTE: `driverUrl` is of the form `spark://CoarseGrainedScheduler@[host]:[port]`.

It executes link:spark-yarn-ExecutorRunnable.adoc[ExecutorRunnable] on <<launcherPool, ContainerLauncher thread pool>> and <<updateInternalState, updates internal state>>.

Any non-fatal exception while running `ExecutorRunnable` is caught and you should see the following ERROR message in the logs:

```
ERROR Failed to launch executor [executorId] on container [containerId]
```

It then immediately releases the failed container (using the internal link:++https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/client/api/AMRMClient.html#releaseAssignedContainer(org.apache.hadoop.yarn.api.records.ContainerId)++[AMRMClient]).

==== [[updateInternalState]] updateInternalState

CAUTION: FIXME

==== [[internalReleaseContainer]] Releasing YARN Container (internalReleaseContainer internal procedure)

All unnecessary YARN containers (that were allocated but are either <<handleAllocatedContainers, of no use>> or <<killExecutor, no longer needed>>) are released using the internal `internalReleaseContainer` procedure.

[source, scala]
----
internalReleaseContainer(container: Container): Unit
----

`internalReleaseContainer` records `container` in the internal <<releasedContainers, releasedContainers>> registry and releases it to the link:spark-yarn-introduction.adoc#ResourceManager[YARN ResourceManager] (calling link:++https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/client/api/AMRMClient.html#releaseAssignedContainer(org.apache.hadoop.yarn.api.records.ContainerId)++[AMRMClient[ContainerRequest\].releaseAssignedContainer] using the internal `amClient`).

==== [[matchContainerToRequest]] Deciding on Use of YARN Container (matchContainerToRequest internal method)

When <<handleAllocatedContainers, `handleAllocatedContainers` handles allocated containers for executors>>, it uses `matchContainerToRequest` to match the containers to `ContainerRequests` (and hence to workload and location preferences).

[source, scala]
----
matchContainerToRequest(
  allocatedContainer: Container,
  location: String,
  containersToUse: ArrayBuffer[Container],
  remaining: ArrayBuffer[Container]): Unit
----

`matchContainerToRequest` puts `allocatedContainer` in `containersToUse` or `remaining` collections per available outstanding `ContainerRequests` that match the priority of the input `allocatedContainer`, the input `location`, and the memory and vcore capabilities for Spark executors.

NOTE: The input `location` can be host, rack, or `*` (star), i.e. any host.

It link:++https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/client/api/AMRMClient.html#getMatchingRequests(org.apache.hadoop.yarn.api.records.Priority, java.lang.String, org.apache.hadoop.yarn.api.records.Resource)++[gets the outstanding `ContainerRequests`] (from the link:spark-yarn-introduction.adoc#ResourceManager[YARN ResourceManager]).

If there are any outstanding `ContainerRequests` that meet the requirements, it simply takes the first one and puts it in the input `containersToUse` collection. It also removes the `ContainerRequest` so it is not submitted again (it uses the internal `AMRMClient[ContainerRequest]`).

Otherwise, it puts the input `allocatedContainer` in the input `remaining` collection.

=== [[launcherPool]] ContainerLauncher Thread Pool

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[processCompletedContainers]] processCompletedContainers

[source, scala]
----
processCompletedContainers(completedContainers: Seq[ContainerStatus]): Unit
----

`processCompletedContainers` accepts a collection of YARN's https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api/records/ContainerStatus.html[ContainerStatus]'es.

[NOTE]
====
`ContainerStatus` represents the current status of a YARN `Container` and provides details such as:

* Id
* State
* Exit status of a completed container.
* Diagnostic message for a failed container.
====

For each completed container in the collection, `processCompletedContainers` removes it from the internal <<releasedContainers, releasedContainers>> registry.

It looks the host of the container up (in the internal <<allocatedContainerToHostMap, allocatedContainerToHostMap>> lookup table). The host may or may not exist in the lookup table.

CAUTION: FIXME The host may or may not exist in the lookup table?

The `ExecutorExited` exit reason is computed.

When the host of the completed container has been found, the internal <<numExecutorsRunning, numExecutorsRunning>> counter is decremented.

You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO Completed container [containerId] [host] (state: [containerState], exit status: [containerExitStatus])
```

For `ContainerExitStatus.SUCCESS` and `ContainerExitStatus.PREEMPTED` exit statuses of the container (which are not considered application failures), you should see one of the two possible INFO messages in the logs:

```
INFO Executor for container [id] exited because of a YARN event (e.g., pre-emption) and not because of an error in the running job.
```

```
INFO Container [id] [host] was preempted.
```

Other exit statuses of the container are considered application failures and reported as a WARN message in the logs:

```
WARN Container killed by YARN for exceeding memory limits. [diagnostics] Consider boosting spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead.
```

or

```
WARN Container marked as failed: [id] [host]. Exit status: [containerExitStatus]. Diagnostics: [containerDiagnostics]
```

The host is looked up in the internal <<allocatedHostToContainersMap, allocatedHostToContainersMap>> lookup table. If found, the container is removed from the containers registered for the host or the host itself is removed from the lookup table when this container was the last on the host.

The container is removed from the internal <<allocatedContainerToHostMap, allocatedContainerToHostMap>> lookup table.

The container is removed from the internal <<containerIdToExecutorId, containerIdToExecutorId>> translation table. If an executor is found, it is removed from the internal <<executorIdToContainer, executorIdToContainer>> translation table.

If the executor was recorded in the internal <<pendingLossReasonRequests, pendingLossReasonRequests>> lookup table, the exit reason (as calculated earlier as `ExecutorExited`) is sent back for every pending RPC message recorded.

If no executor was found, the executor and the exit reason are recorded in the internal <<releasedExecutorLossReasons, releasedExecutorLossReasons>> lookup table.

In case the container was not in the internal <<releasedContainers, releasedContainers>> registry, the internal <<numUnexpectedContainerRelease, numUnexpectedContainerRelease>> counter is increased and a `RemoveExecutor` RPC message is sent to the driver (as specified when <<creating-instance, `YarnAllocator` was created>>) to notify about the failure of the executor.

=== [[allocateResources]] Allocating YARN Containers for Executors and Cancelling Outstanding Containers (allocateResources method)

After link:spark-yarn-applicationmaster.adoc#registerAM[`ApplicationMaster` is registered to the YARN ResourceManager] Spark calls `allocateResources`.

[source, scala]
----
allocateResources(): Unit
----

`allocateResources` claims new resource containers from link:spark-yarn-introduction.adoc#ResourceManager[YARN ResourceManager] and cancels any outstanding resource container requests.

NOTE: In YARN, you have to submit requests for resource containers to link:spark-yarn-introduction.adoc#ResourceManager[YARN ResourceManager] first (using link:++https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/client/api/AMRMClient.html#addContainerRequest(T)++[AMRMClient.addContainerRequest]) before claiming them by calling link:++https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/client/api/AMRMClient.html#allocate(float)++[AMRMClient.allocate].

Internally, `allocateResources` starts by <<updateResourceRequests, submitting requests for new containers and cancelling previous container requests>>.

`allocateResources` then link:++https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/client/api/AMRMClient.html#allocate(float)++[claims the containers] (using the internal reference to YARN's `AMRMClient`) with progress indicator of `0.1f`.

You can see the exact moment in the YARN console for the Spark application with the progress bar at 10%.

If the number of allocated containers is greater than `0`, you should see the following DEBUG message in the logs (in stderr on YARN):

```

```

`allocateResources` <<handleAllocatedContainers, launches executors on the allocated YARN containers>>.

`releasedContainers` contains containers of no use anymore by their globally unique identifier https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api/records/ContainerId.html[ContainerId] (for a `Container` in the cluster).

NOTE: Hadoop YARN's https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api/records/Container.html[Container] represents an allocated resource in the cluster. The YARN ResourceManager is the sole authority to allocate any `Container` to applications. The allocated `Container` is always on a single node and has a unique `ContainerId`. It has a specific amount of `Resource` allocated.

==== [[targetNumExecutors]] Desired Total Number of Executors (targetNumExecutors Internal Attribute)

Initially, when <<creating-instance, `YarnAllocator` is created>>, `targetNumExecutors` corresponds to the link:spark-yarn-YarnSparkHadoopUtil.adoc#getInitialTargetExecutorNumber[initial number of executors].

`targetNumExecutors` is eventually reached after <<updateResourceRequests, `YarnAllocator` updates YARN container allocation requests>>.

It may later be changed when <<requestTotalExecutorsWithPreferredLocalities, `YarnAllocator` is requested for executors given locality preferences>>.
