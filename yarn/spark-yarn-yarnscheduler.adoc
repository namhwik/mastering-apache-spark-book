== [[YarnScheduler]] YarnScheduler - TaskScheduler for Client Deploy Mode

`YarnScheduler` is the link:spark-taskscheduler.adoc[TaskScheduler] for link:README.adoc[Spark on YARN] in link:spark-submit.adoc#deploy-mode[client deploy mode].

It is a custom link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc[TaskSchedulerImpl] with ability to compute racks per hosts, i.e. it comes with a specialized <<getRackForHost, getRackForHost>>.

It also sets `org.apache.hadoop.yarn.util.RackResolver` logger to `WARN` if not set already.

=== [[getRackForHost]] Tracking Racks per Hosts and Ports (getRackForHost method)

`getRackForHost` attempts to compute the rack for a host.

NOTE: `getRackForHost` overrides the link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#getRackForHost[parent TaskSchedulerImpl's getRackForHost]

It simply uses Hadoop's `org.apache.hadoop.yarn.util.RackResolver` to resolve a hostname to its network location, i.e. a rack.
