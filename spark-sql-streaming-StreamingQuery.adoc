== [[StreamingQuery]] StreamingQuery

`StreamingQuery` provides an interface for interacting with a query that executes continuously in background.

NOTE: `StreamingQuery` is called *continuous query* or *stream query*.

`StreamingQuery` has a name and belongs to a single link:spark-sql-sqlcontext.adoc[SQLContext].

NOTE: `StreamingQuery` is a Scala trait with the only implementation being link:spark-sql-streaming-streamexecution.adoc[StreamExecution].

`StreamingQuery` can be in two states:

* active (started)
* inactive (stopped)

If inactive, `StreamingQuery` may have transitioned into the state due to an `StreamingQueryException` (that is available under `exception`).

`StreamingQuery` tracks current state of all the sources, i.e. `SourceStatus`, as `sourceStatuses`.

There could only be a single link:spark-sql-streaming-sink.adoc[Sink] for a `StreamingQuery` with many link:spark-sql-streaming-source.adoc[Sources].

`StreamingQuery` can be stopped by `stop` or an exception.
